I'm TJ, I'm currently attending Oklahoma State University pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems with an Information Assuarance option. Hobbies range from playing video games, hiking, and going on adventures with my dog, Django. I am from Texas but I choose Oklahoma State because I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and they also awarded me a good deal of scholarship money hahah.
